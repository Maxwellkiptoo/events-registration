# Event Ticketing System
This system is a Python-based application designed to help event organizers track sales and manage customer registrations efficiently. The system allows customers to purchase tickets while ensuring compliance with age restrictions and ticket availability.
## Features
1. Customer Management
- **List All Customers**: View all registered customers with their details.
- **Add New Customer**: Register a new customer with a unique ID, name, birthdate, and email.
2. Event Management
- **List Events**: Display all available events, including age restrictions, dates, and ticket availability.
- **List Future Events**: Show upcoming events that still have tickets available.
3. Ticket Sales & Tracking
- **Buy Tickets**: Customers can purchase tickets if they meet the event criteria.
- **Track Customer Purchases**: See which customers have bought tickets and for which events.
4. User Interaction & Navigation
- **Interactive Menu**: A simple menu-driven system for easy navigation.
- **Validation Checks**: Ensures correct data input, prevents overbooking, and enforces age restrictions.
## How It Works
1. **Run the Python script** to launch the ticketing system.
2. **Navigate through the menu** to register customers, list events, and buy tickets.
3. **Ticket purchases are validated** based on availability and customer eligibility.
4. **Future events are listed dynamically**, ensuring past events are not displayed.
